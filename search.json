Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (“On this page”).\nIf you’ve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\nSample raster plot - for detailed raster plotting instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\nWarning: package 'terra' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nterra 1.7.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){ ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red) return(ndvi) }\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir.astype(float)-red.astype(float))/(nir.astype(float)+red.astype(float))\n  return(ndvi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites.

The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was created using rasterize_terrain() with the tin() algorithm.\n The DSM was then generated by rasterizing the highest lidar returns with rasterize_canopy() , capturing the uppermost surfaces. Since the CHM represents vegetation height above the ground, the lidar point cloud was normalized using normalize_height(), which adjusted elevation values so that ground points were set to zero. Finally, the Canopy Height Model (CHM) was derived from the normalized LiDAR data using rasterize_canopy(), representing vegetation heights across the study area."

Training data for six landcover types—vegetation, ocean water, river discharge, urban area, snow, and exposed rocks were manually created. The Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) and neural network algorithm were then applied to classify each pixel based on spectral characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 1. Satellite images of Howe Sound on a winter and summer day at 10m resolution.\nTo predict future debris hotspots, a debris movement simulation model will be developed using a Howe Sound cartographic shapefile. The model will incorporate wind and river discharge as driving forces to visualize debris transport. Based on surface water variations Howe Sound will be divided into three sections: Northern Howe Sound (Squamish to Britannia Beach), Central Howe Sound (Britannia Beach to Anvil Island), and Southern Howe Sound (South Anvil Island to the Strait of Georgia). This division will help refine debris transport predictions."
