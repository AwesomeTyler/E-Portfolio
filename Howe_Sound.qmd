 <span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="margin-right: 30px;"></span> Marine debris threatens Howe Sound, yet its accumulation remains unstudied. This research analyzes debris hotspots via superised satellite imagery classification and models future movement using wind and river discharge </span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="margin-right: 30px;"></span> A total of 49 debris hotspots were identified using the debris pathway simulation model, with 20 of them overlapping existing resident-reported debris hotspots. By mapping debris pathways and identifying high-risk zones, this study aims to support conservation efforts and improve debris management strategies in the region. </span><br>

## Classification

 <span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="margin-right: 30px;"></span> Multi-band satellite images (20m resolution) were merged into a true-color composite in ArcGIS Pro. Training data for six landcover types—vegetation, ocean water, river discharge, urban area, snow, and exposed rocks—were manually created, and classification was performed using Maximum Likelihood Classification and a neural network algorithm. Figure 2 presents the classified maps of the Howe Sound study area, revealing seasonal patterns: reduced snow cover in summer and lower river discharge in winter. These findings suggest that river discharge drives debris accumulation in northern and central Howe Sound primarily during summer. Additionally, there's a missing in debris hotspot along the western shoreline of Howe Sound, possibly due to lower population density and less resident reports. </span><br>

## Wind Data

 <span style="font-size: 22px;"><span style="margin-right: 30px;"></span> Another significant driving force for debris movement is wind. In Howe Sound, four stations collect hourly wind data. The wind rose diagrams for summer (June–August) and winter (December–February) at Squamish Airport, Point Atkinson, Pam Rock, and Port Mellon stations are shown in Figure 3.  </span><br>
